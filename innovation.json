Engineer who encrypts the world, one should know how Hacking activities are done. And we must stand front in protecting our world from cybercriminals.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeing able to gain access to a system that you\\u2019re not supposed to have access to is known as Hacking. For example, login into an email account without authorization is considered hacking that account. Gaining access to a remote computer without authorization is hacking that computer. So you can see that there are a large number of ways to hack into a system and the word hacking can refer to a number of things but the main concept is the same. Gaining access or being able to do things that you\\u2019re not supposed to be able to do, is considered hacking.\\r\\n\\r\\nEthical hacking:\\r\\nTo crack passwords or to steal data? No, it is much more than that. Ethical hacking is to scan vulnerabilities and to find potential threats on a computer or networks. An ethical hacker finds the weak points or loopholes in a computer, web applications or network and reports them to the organization. So, let\\u2019s explore more about Ethical Hacking step-by-step.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese are various types of hackers:\\r\\n\\r\\n    Black hat hackers:\\r\\n    Here, the organization doesn\\u2019t allow the user to test it. They unethically enter inside the website and steal data from the admin panel or manipulate the data. They only focus on themselves and the advantages they will get from the personal data for personal financial gain. They can cause major damage to the company by altering the functions which lead to the loss of the company at a much higher extent. This can even lead you to extreme consequences.\\r\\n\\r\\n    White hat hackers:\\r\\n    Here, we look for bugs and ethically report it to the organization. We are authorized as a user to test for bugs in a website or network and report it to them. White hat hackers generally get all the needed information about the application or network to test for, from the organization itself. They use their skills to test it before the website goes live or attacked by malicious hackers.\\r\\n    3.Grey hat hackers:\\r\\n    They sometimes access to the data and violates the law. But never have the same intention as Black hat hackers, they often operate for the common good. The main difference is that they exploit vulnerability publicly whereas white hat hackers do it privately for the company. \\r\\n\\r\\nNote: To know more about types of hackers click here.\\r\\nWhy Python Programming For Hacking\\r\\n\\r\\nPython is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language. Python is a very simple language yet powerful scripting language, it\\u2019s open-source and object-oriented and it has great libraries that can be used for both for hacking and for writing very useful normal programs other than hacking programs. In the future and present era python is very popular and it\\u2019s easy to learn, learning to hack with python will be fun and you will learn python programming in the best way. There is a great demand for python developers in the market.\\r\\n\\r\\nNote: To know more about python click here.\\r\\nHow Password Are Hacked\\r\\n\\r\\nEveryone knows that passwords are not stored a plain text in the website\\u2019s database. Now we are going to see how to hack a plain text password when you find a password that is in hashed(md5) format. So we take the input_hash(hashed password in the database) and try to compare it with md5 hash of every plain text password which is in a password file(pass_doc) and when the hashes are matched we simply display the plain text password which is in the password file(pass_doc). If the password is not present in the input password file it will say password is not found, this happens only if buffer overflow doesn\\u2019t occur. This type of attack can be considered as a dictionary attack.\", \"filter\": \"Document\", \"id\": 1371, \"keyWord\": \"python hacking \", \"spin\": 80, \"status\": 4, \"total_crawled_result\": null}]], {}]", "task_hash": "3eae99ab0671e5f33df958a63fed562a1ddb87f2", "verbose_name": null, "priority": 0, "run_at": "2020-09-01T10:30:42.391Z", "repeat": 0, "repeat_until": null, "queue": null, "attempts": 0, "failed_at": null, "last_error": "", "locked_by": "10648", "locked_at": "2020-09-01T10:31:11.084Z", "creator_content_type": null, "creator_object_id": null}}, {"model": "background_task.completedtask", "pk": 1, "fields": {"task_name": "api.utils.notify_user", "task_params": "[[[{\"description\": \"this is my skateboard\", \"filter\": \"Website\", \"id\": 186, \"keyWord\": \"skateboard\", \"spin\": 80, \"status\": 0}, {\"description\": \"Text\", \"filter\": \"Website\", \"id\": 187, \"keyWord\": \"Flying car\", \"spin\": 80, \"status\": 0}]], {}]", "task_hash": "d78b2222cd8c9d38d838455c7ec7fb4803002629", "verbose_name": null, "priority": 0, "run_at": "2020-05-04T09:35:44.285Z", "repeat": 0, "repeat_until": null, "queue": null, "attempts": 1, "failed_at": null, "last_error": "", "locked_by": "9653", "locked_at": "2020-05-04T09:32:58.556Z", "creator_content_type": null, "creator_object_id": null}}, {"model": "background_task.completedtask", "pk": 2, "fields": {"task_name": "api.utils.notify_user", "task_params": "[[[]], {}]", "task_hash": "3c24b98290e4a1e3f7305789b652baf8d7bbdb5e", "verbose_name": null, "priority": 0, "run_at": "2020-05-04T09:45:32.167Z", "repeat": 0, "repeat_until": null, "queue": null, "attempts": 1, "failed_at": null, "last_error": "", "locked_by": "10231", "locked_at": "2020-05-04T09:45:13.271Z", "creator_content_type": null, "creator_object_id": null}}, {"model": "background_task.completedtask", "pk": 3, "fields": {"task_name": "api.utils.Documen_job", "task_params": "[[[{\"description\": \"skatebOard_websites\", \"filter\": \"Website\", \"id\": 190, \"keyWord\": \"skateboard\", \"spin\": 80, \"status\": 0}]], {}]", "task_hash": "8fb5f7f0658e50dedc3646ff3bcabb259ec0a891", "verbose_name": null, "priority": 0, "run_at": "2020-05-05T12:32:53.763Z", "repeat": 0, "repeat_until": null, "queue": null, "attempts": 1, "failed_at": null, "last_error": "", "locked_by": "2689", "locked_at": "2020-05-05T12:32:37.525Z", "creator_content_type": null, "creator_object_id": null}}, {"model": "background_task.completedtask", "pk": 4, "fields": {"task_name": "api.utils.Documen_job", "task_params": "[[[{\"description\": \"A flying car is a type of personal air vehicle or roadable aircraft that provides door-to-door transportation by both ground and air.

Possibility to trace food back to its grower in seconds. Blockchain makes a supply chain more transparent at an all-new level. It also empowers the entire chain to be more responsive to any food safety disasters. Blockchain also allows specific products to be traced at any given time, which would help to reduce food waste.\", \"filter\": \"Website\", \"id\": 464, \"keyWord\": \"testblockchain

Possibility to trace food back to its grower in seconds. Blockchain makes a supply chain more transparent at an all-new level. It also empowers the entire chain to be more responsive to any food safety disasters. Blockchain also allows specific products to be traced at any given time, which would help to reduce food waste.\", \"filter\": \"Website\", \"id\": 482, \"keyWord\": \"testblockchain

The PAL-V Liberty roadable aircraft targeted 2021 to become the first flying car in full production. Their appearance is often predicted by futurologists, with their failure ever to reach production leading to the catchphrase, Where's my flying car?

And we must stand front in protecting our world from cybercriminals.\r\n\r\nBeing able to gain access to a system that you\u2019re not supposed to have access to is known as Hacking. For example, login into an email account without authorization is considered hacking that account. Gaining access to a remote computer without authorization is hacking that computer. So you can see that there are a large number of ways to hack into a system and the word hacking can refer to a number of things but the main concept is the same. Gaining access or being able to do things that you\u2019re not supposed to be able to do, is considered hacking.\r\n\r\nEthical hacking:\r\nTo crack passwords or to steal data? No, it is much more than that. Ethical hacking is to scan vulnerabilities and to find potential threats on a computer or networks. An ethical hacker finds the weak points or loopholes in a computer, web applications or network and reports them to the organization. So, let\u2019s explore more about Ethical Hacking step-by-step.\r\n\r\nThese are various types of hackers:\r\n\r\n    Black hat hackers:\r\n    Here, the organization doesn\u2019t allow the user to test it. They unethically enter inside the website and steal data from the admin panel or manipulate the data. They only focus on themselves and the advantages they will get from the personal data for personal financial gain. They can cause major damage to the company by altering the functions which lead to the loss of the company at a much higher extent. This can even lead you to extreme consequences.\r\n\r\n    White hat hackers:\r\n    Here, we look for bugs and ethically report it to the organization. We are authorized as a user to test for bugs in a website or network and report it to them. White hat hackers generally get all the needed information about the application or network to test for, from the organization itself. They use their skills to test it before the website goes live or attacked by malicious hackers.\r\n    3.Grey hat hackers:\r\n    They sometimes access to the data and violates the law. But never have the same intention as Black hat hackers, they often operate for the common good. The main difference is that they exploit vulnerability publicly whereas white hat hackers do it privately for the company. \r\n\r\nNote: To know more about types of hackers click here.\r\nWhy Python Programming For Hacking\r\n\r\nPython is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language. Python is a very simple language yet powerful scripting language, it\u2019s open-source and object-oriented and it has great libraries that can be used for both for hacking and for writing very useful normal programs other than hacking programs. In the future and present era python is very popular and it\u2019s easy to learn, learning to hack with python will be fun and you will learn python programming in the best way. There is a great demand for python developers in the market.\r\n\r\nNote: To know more about python click here.\r\nHow Password Are Hacked\r\n\r\nEveryone knows that passwords are not stored a plain text in the website\u2019s database. Now we are going to see how to hack a plain text password when you find a password that is in hashed(md5) format. So we take the input_hash(hashed password in the database) and try to compare it with md5 hash of every plain text password which is in a password file(pass_doc) and when the hashes are matched we simply display the plain text password which is in the password file(pass_doc). If the password is not present in the input password file it will say password is not found, this happens only if buffer overflow doesn\u2019t occur. This type of attack can be considered as a dictionary attack.", "filter": "Document", "total_crawled_result": 322, "spin": 80, "status": 2}}, {"model": "searchBar.searchresult", "pk": 19292, "fields": {"url": "https://terrafugia.com/", "title": "Terrafugia | The Future of Personal Transportation | The Flying ...", "description": "THE FLYING CAR IS HERE.
